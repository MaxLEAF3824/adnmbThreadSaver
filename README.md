# adnmbThreadSaver

adnmb.com is an anonymous forum, which is similar to 4chan and 2ch. Saving threads from this website is a very inconvenient thing, but at the same time, there are many interesting posts on the website.   
This is a simple python script, which saves threads from adnmb.com, it's based on selenium so you need to download selenium package and the corresponding webdriver for you web browser.this repo includes the source and a executable file.(But Runing the exe requires an extra webdriver fire, which is expected to download by yourself.)  
For more information, please check readme.txt  
  
Hope you enjoy it :)
